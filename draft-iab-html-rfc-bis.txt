Abstract

   In order to meet the evolving needs of the Internet community, the
   format for RFCs is changing from a plain-text, ASCII-only format to a
   canonical XML format that will in turn be rendered into several
   publication formats.  This document defines the HTML format that will
   be rendered for an RFC or Internet-Draft.

Status of This Memo

   This Internet-Draft is submitted in full conformance with the
   provisions of BCP 78 and BCP 79.

1.  Introduction

   As described in [I-D.iab-rfc-framework], the RFC Series is changing.
   One of those changes includes the RFC Editor publishing a non-
   canonical HTML version of RFCs.

   This document describes the HTML format that will be used as one of
   the publication formats for the RFC Series.  It defines a strict
   subset of HTML appropriate for RFC Series documents.  The visual
   layout of the document will be defined through a cascading style
   sheet (CSS) [W3C.REC-CSS2-20110607].  The CSS will be included in the
   HTML file but will be described in [I-D.iab-rfc-css].

   The details (particularly any vocabularies) described in this
   document are expected to change based on experience gained in
   implementing the RFC production center's toolset.  Revised documents
   will be published capturing those changes as the toolset is
   completed.  Other implementers must not expect those changes to
   remain backwards-compatible with the details described this document.

Internet-Draft                  HTML RFC                       July 2016


2.  Requirements for the HTML Format

   This section lists the design requirements used to create the HTML
   format described in this document.  These requirements build on those
   found in [RFC6949].  Many of these requirements are naturally
   fulfilled by using the output of the preparation tool
   [I-D.iab-rfcv3-preptool].

   o  The HTML has to render correctly on a list of browser versions
      that the RFC Editor will keep up to date outside of this document.

   o  The format will consist of a subset of HTML deemed to be widely
      implemented by common browsers at the time the specification is
      created, likely to continue to be widely-implemented, and unlikely
      to cause security issues.  This will maximize the chances that
      future HTML renderers (such as new web browsers) will continue to
      produce readable text from the HTML format without the format
      needing to be changed frequently.

   o  These requirements are expected to change in the future to reflect
      the expectation that HTML rendering will be required for current
      versions of browsers and platforms, while ideally continuing to
      render correctly on recent versions of those browsers.

   o  The HTML documents from the RFC Editor or Internet-Drafts
      directory may be re-rendered from the canonical XML format in the
      future to ensure the ongoing readability of the documents.  The
      intent is that any re-rendering would be due to exceptional
      circumstances rather than for minor annoyances.

   o  The HTML must display adequately in at least one text-based
      browser.  Some consumers of the RFC series can only access the
      series on text-based terminals.

   o  The HTML document will be self-contained, without requiring
      external files for images, CSS, JavaScript, or the like.  This
      will allow the HTML file to be moved over various non-HTTP
      transports (such as e-mail, FTP, and rsync) without breakage.

   o  JavaScript will be supported on a limited basis.  It will not be
      permitted to overwrite or change any text present in the rendered
      html.  It may, on a limited basis, add additional text that
      provides post-publication metadata or pointers if warranted.  All
      such text will be clearly marked as additional.

   o  The HTML document will allow easy local override of the default
      CSS formatting.  This will allow users who have a different visual
      style that they prefer to make RFCs display with that style

      without having to alter the contents of the HTML document.  This
      might also be valuable for allowing people with specific
      accessibility needs to use a customized CSS.

   o  HTML tags in documents will rarely have attributes whose only
      purpose is to affect the rendered styling, and those will only be
      used if it would not be possible to specify that styling in CSS.
      No such attributes are known at this time.

   o  Both user-defined and auto-generated anchors must be supported and
      linkable, with user-defined anchors appearing in an "id"
      attribute.  Auto-generated anchors will be generated for every
      heading, paragraph, and so on, not just those that do not have
      user-defined anchors.  User-defined anchors may, and auto-
      generated anchors will, appear next to paragraphs, figures,
      tables, blockquotes, and section titles.

   o  All section, subsections, figures, and paragraphs should have
      stable numbered link anchors.  Additionally, anchors expressed in
      the source XML should be exposed as anchors in the HTML output as
      well.

   o  The HTML must make it easy to separate sections along with all of
      their subsections into separate files.  This will make creating
      EPUB documents easier in the future.

   o  The HTML produced for Internet-Drafts will differ from that
      produced by the RFC Editor due to differences in the output from
      the prep tool.

   o  The abstract must be marked up or tagged in a way that popular
      search engines will extract it as a summary.

2.1.  Requirements for Accessibility

   o  Normative information must be easily accessible to the following
      consumers:

      *  People with impaired vision, including those that use large
         fonts and those that use screen readers

      *  People with difficulty distinguishing between colors

      *  People who use devices with small screens, such as cell phones

   o  Specific instances where goals for accessibility are important in
      the design choices of the format have been called out in the text.

   o  NOTE: designing for these consumers does not preclude the use of
      features they cannot use, but does require that key semantic data
      is not lost when read using the tools and settings that are
      required by a given constituency.

3.  HTML Version

   The RFC Editor will periodically determine which version of the HTML
   specification will be referenced for tools generating the format
   defined in this document.  The starting version will be that defined
   in [W3C.REC-html5-20141028], commonly known as "HTML5".  Although the
   HTML specification mandates several of the syntax and structure rules
   described in this document, they are called out here for emphasis.

4.  HTML Syntax

   The processor emitting HTML from the XML source will follow these
   rules:

   o  The HTML output is encoded as UTF-8, as specified in [RFC3629].

   o  The document is valid HTML.

   o  Double quotes (U+0022 QUOTATION MARK: ") are used to quote
      attribute values unless the HTML specification forbids quoting a
      particular attribute.

   o  Each logical line is terminated solely with a \n (U+000A: LINE
      FEED), otherwise known as "Unix-style" line endings.

   o  Code points below (U+0020: SPACE) or character entity references
      that generate them (e.g. &#9;), other than (U+000A: LINE FEED) may
      not be used.  NOTE: this rule explicitly forbids \t (U+0009:
      CHARACTER TABULATION), \f (U+000C: FORM FEED), and \r (U+000D:
      CARRIAGE RETURN) from appearing in the HTML output.

   o  Comments in the source XML, if any, will not be copied into the
      HTML.

   o  The HTML output will be pretty-printed, using whatever consistent
      rules are deemed best by the developers of the HTML production
      tools.

   NOTE: none of these rules affect the rendered output of the HTML, but
   are intended to increase the chance that text comparison tools (e.g.,
   "diff") that operate on the HTML output easier to write.

5.  Common Items

   This section lists items that are common across multiple parts of the
   HTML document.

5.1.  IDs

   HTML elements that are generated from XML elements that include an
   "anchor" attribute will use the value of the "anchor" attribute as
   the value of the "id" attribute of the corresponding HTML element.
   The prep tool produces XML with "anchor" attributes in all elements
   that need them.  Some HTML constructs (such as <section>) will use
   multiple instances of these identifiers.

5.2.  Pilcrows

   Each paragraph, artwork, or sourcecode segment outside of a <figure>
   or <table> element will be appended with a space and a "pilcrow"
   (U+00B6: PILCROW SIGN), otherwise known as a "paragraph sign".  For
   the purposes of clarity in ASCII renderings of this document, in this
   document pilcrows are rendered as "&para;".  The pilcrow will be
   linked to the "id" attribute on the XML entity to which it is
   associated using an <a> element of class "pilcrow".  For example:

   <p id="s-1.1-1">
     Some paragraph text. <a class="pilcrow" href="#s-1.1-1">&para;</a>
   </p>

   The pilcrow will normally be invisible unless the element it is
   attached to is moused over.  The pilcrow will be surrounded by a link
   that points to the element it is attached to.

   Pilcrows are never included inside a <table> or <figure> element,
   since the figure number or table number serves as an adequate link
   target.

   Elements that might otherwise contain a pilcrow do not get marked
   with a pilcrow if they contain one or more child elements that are
   marked with a pilcrow.  For example:

   <blockquote id="s-1.2-1">
     <p id="s-1.2-2">Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought
       forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and
       dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.
       <a href="#s-1.2-2" class="pilcrow">&para;</a></p>
     <!-- NO pilcrow here -->
   </blockquote>

Internet-Draft                  HTML RFC                       July 2016


6.  Front Matter

   The front matter of the HTML format contains processing information,
   metadata of various types, and styling information that applies to
   the document as a whole.  This section describes HTML that is not
   necessarily a direct transform from the XML format.  For more details
   on each of the tags that generate content in this section, see
   Section 9.

6.1.  DOCTYPE

   The DOCTYPE of the document is "html", which declares that the
   document is compliant with HTML5.  The document will start with
   exactly this string:

   <!DOCTYPE html>

6.2.  Root Element

   The root element of the document is <html>.  This element includes a
   lang attribute, whose value is a [RFC5646] language tag describing
   the natural language of the document.  The language tag to be
   included is "en".  The class of the <html> element will be copied
   verbatim from the XML <rfc> element's <front> element's <seriesInfo>
   element's "name" attributes (separated by spaces), allowing CSS to
   style RFCs and Internet-Drafts differently from one another (if
   needed):

   <html lang="en" class="RFC">

6.3.  Head Element

   The root <html> will contain a <head> element that contains the
   following elements, as needed.

6.3.1.  Charset Declaration

   In order to be correctly processed by browsers that load the HTML
   using a mechanism that does not provide a valid content-type or
   charset (such as from a local file system using a "file:" URL), the
   HTML <head> element contains a <meta> element, with charset attribute
   with value "utf-8":

   <meta charset="utf-8">

Internet-Draft                  HTML RFC                       July 2016


6.3.2.  Document Title

   The contents of the <title> element from the XML source will be
   placed inside an HTML <title> element in the header.

6.3.3.  Document Metadata

   The following <meta> elements will be included:

   o  author - one each for the each of the "fullname"s and
      "asciiFullname"s of all of the <author>s from the <front> of the
      XML source

   o  description - the <abstract> from the XML source

   o  generator - the name and version number of the software used to
      create the HTML

   o  keywords - comma-separated <keyword>s from the XML source

   For example:

   <meta name="author" content="Joe Hildebrand">
   <meta name="author" content="JOE HILDEBRAND">
   <meta name="author" content="Heather Flanagan">
   <meta name="description" content="This document defines...">
   <meta name="generator" content="xmljade v0.2.4">
   <meta name="keywords" content="html,css,rfc">

   Note: the HTML <meta> tag does not contain a closing slash.

6.3.4.  Link to XML source

   The <head> element contains a <link> tag, with "rel" attribute of
   "alternate", "type" attribute of "application/rfc+xml", and "href"
   attribute pointing to the prepared XML source that was used to
   generate this document.

   <link rel="alternate" type="application/rfc+xml" href="source.xml">

6.3.5.  Link to License

   The <head> element contains a <link> tag, with "rel" attribute of
   "license" and "href" attribute pointing to the an appropriate
   copyright license for the document.

   <link rel="license" href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/copyright/">

Internet-Draft                  HTML RFC                       July 2016


6.3.6.  Style

   The <head> element contains an embedded CSS style sheet in a <style>
   element.  The styles in the style sheet are to be set consistently
   between documents by the RFC Editor, according to the best practices
   of the day.

   To ensure consistent formatting, individual style attributes should
   not be used in the main portion of the document.

   Different readers of a specification will desire different formatting
   when reading the HTML versions of RFCs.  To facilitate this, the
   <head> element also includes a <link> to a style sheet in the same
   directory as the HTML file, named "rfc-local.css".  Any formatting in
   the linked style sheet will override the formatting in the included
   style sheet.  For example:

   <style>
     body {}
     ...
   </style>
   <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="rfc-local.css">

6.3.7.  Links

   Each <link> element from the XML source is copied into the HTML
   header.  Note: the HTML <link> element does not include a closing
   slash.

6.4.  Page Headers and Footers

   In order to simplify printing by HTML renderers that implement
   [W3C.WD-css3-page-20130314], a hidden HTML <table> tag of class
   "ears" is added at the beginning of the HTML <body> tag, containing
   HTML <thead> and <tfoot> tags, each of which contains an HTML <tr>
   tag, which contains three HTML <td> tags with class "left", "center",
   and "right", respectively.

   The <thead> corresponds to the top of the page, the <tfoot> to the
   bottom.  The string "[Page]" can be used as a placeholder for the
   page number.  In practice, this must always be in the <tfoot>'s right
   <td>, and no control of the page number formatting is implied.

6.5.  Document Information

   Information about the document as a whole will appear as the first
   child of the HTML <body> element, embedded in an HTML <dl> element
   with id="identifiers".  The defined terms in the definition list are
   "Workgroup:", "Series:", "Status:", "Published:", and "Author:" or
   "Authors:" (as appropriate).  For example:

6.6.  Table of Contents

   The table of contents will follow the boilerplate if the XML's <rfc>
   element's tocInclude attribute has the value "true".  An HTML <h2>
   heading containing the text "Table of Contents" will be followed by a
   <nav> element that contains a <ul> element for each depth of the
   section hierarchy.  Each section will be represented by a <li>
   element containing links by the section number (from the "pn"
   attribute) and by the name (from the "slugifiedName" attribute of the
   <name> child element).  Each <nav>, <ul>, and <li> element will have
   the class "toc".

   For example:

7.  Main Body

   The main body of the HTML document is processed according to the
   rules in Section 9.

8.  Back Matter

   The back matter of the HTML document includes an index (if
   generated), information about the authors, and further information
   about the document itself.

8.1.  Index

   The index will be produced at the end of the document (before the
   author information) if and only if the XML document's <rfc> element
   has an indexInclude attribute with the value "true", and there is one
   or more <iref> elements in the document.

8.1.1.  Index Contents

   The index section will start with an <h2> heading containing the text
   "Index", followed by links to each of the lettered portions of the
   index.  Links are not generated for letters that do not occur as the
   first letter of an index item.

   For example:

   <h2>Index</h2>
   <div class="index">
     <div class="indexIndex">
       <a href="#rfc.index.C">C</a>
       <a href="#rfc.index.P">P</a>
     </div>
     ...

Internet-Draft                  HTML RFC                       July 2016


8.1.2.  Index Letters

   The index letter is followed by a <ul> tag that contains a <li> tag
   for each first letter represented in the index.  This <li> tag has
   the class "indexChar", and contains an <a> tag with the id pointed to
   by the index letter, as well as an href to itself.  The <li> tag also
   includes a <ul> tag that will contain the index items.

   For example:

   <ul>
     <li class="indexChar">
       <a href="#rfc.index.C" id="rfc.index.C">C</a>
       <ul>
         <!-- items go here -->
       </ul>
     </li>
     ...

8.1.3.  Index Items

   Each index item can have multiple <iref> elements to point to, all
   with the same item attribute.  Each index item is represented by an
   <li> tag of class "indexItem" containing a <span> of class "irefItem"
   for the item text and one of class "irefRefs" for the generated
   references (if there is at least one reference to the item not having
   a subitem).  Each generated reference contains an <a> tag containing
   the section number where the <iref> was found, with an "href"
   attribute pointing to the "irefid" attribute of the <iref> element
   from the XML document.  If the primary attribute of the <iref>
   element has the value "true", the <a> element in the HTML document
   will have the class "indexPrimary".  Commas may be used to separate
   the generated references.

   For example:

   <li class="indexItem">
     <span class="irefItem">Bullets</span>
     <span class="irefRefs">
       <a class="indexPrimary" href="#s-Bullets-1">2</a>,
       <a href="#s-Bullets-2">2</a>
     </span>
     <!-- subitems go here -->
   </li>
   ...

Internet-Draft                  HTML RFC                       July 2016


8.1.4.  Index Sub-items

   If an index item has at least one subitem, the <li> of that item will
   contain a <ul>, with one <li> for each subitem, of class
   "indexSubItem".  Each subitem is formatted similarly to items, except
   the class of the first <span> tag is "irefSubItem".

   For example:

   <ul>
     <li class="indexSubItem">
       <span class="irefSubItem">Ordered</span>
       <span class="irefRefs">
         <a href="#s-Bullets-Ordered-1">2</a>
       </span>
     </li>
   </ul>
   ...

8.2.  Authors' Addresses

   At the end of the document, author information will be included
   inside an HTML <section> element whose id attribute is "author-
   addresses".  The class names of the constituent HTML tags have been
   chosen to match the class names in [HCARD].

   The information for each author will be separated by an HTML <hr>
   element with class "addr"

   <section id="author-addresses">
     <h2>
       <a class="selfRef" href="#author-addresses">

8.3.  Document Information

   A few bits of metadata about the document that are less important to
   most readers are included after the author information.  These are
   gathered together into a <div> of class "docInfo".

   The finalized time is copied from the <rfc> element's prepTime
   attribute.  The rendered time is the time that this HTML was
   generated.

   For example:

   <div class="docInfo">
     <span class="finalized">
       Finalized: <time
       datetime="2015-04-29T18:59:08Z">2015-04-29T18:59:08Z</time>
     </span>
     <span class="rendered">
       Rendered: <time
       datetime="2015-04-29T18:59:10Z">2015-04-29T18:59:10Z</time>
     </span>
   </div>

9.  Elements

   This section describes how each of the XML elements from
   [I-D.iab-xml2rfc] is rendered to HTML.  Many of the descriptions have
   examples to clarify how elements will be rendered.

9.1.  <abstract>

   The abstract is rendered similarly to a <section> with
   anchor="abstract" and <name>Abstract</name>, but without a section
   number.

   <section id="abstract">
     <h2><a href="#abstract" class="selfRef">Abstract</a></h2>
     <p id="s-abstract-1">This document defines...
       <a href="#s-abstract-1" class="pilcrow">&para;</a>
     </p>
   </section>

9.2.  <address>

   This element is used in Authors' Addresses.  It is rendered as an
   HTML <address> tag of class "vcard".  If none of the descendant XML
   elements has an "ascii" attribute, the <address> HTML tag includes
   the HTML rendering of each of the descendant XML elements.



Hildebrand & Hoffman    Expires January 18, 2017               [Page 17]

Internet-Draft                  HTML RFC                       July 2016


   Otherwise, the <address> HTML tag includes an HTML <div> tag of class
   "ascii" (containing the HTML rendering of the ASCII variants of each
   of the descendant XML elements), an HTML <div> tag of class
   "alternative-contact", (containing the text "Alternate contact
   information:"), and an HTML <div> tag of class "non-ascii"
   (containing the HTML rendering of the non-ASCII variants of each of
   the descendant XML elements).

   Note: The following example shows some ASCII equivalents that are the
   same as their nominal equivalents for clarity; normally the ASCII
   equivalents would not be included for these cases.

   <address class="vcard">
     <div class="ascii">
       <div class="nameRole"><span class="fn">Joe Hildebrand</span>
         (<span class="role">editor</span>)</div>
       <div class="org">Cisco Systems, Inc.</div>
     </div>
     <div class="alternative-contact">
       Alternate contact information:
     </div>
     <div class="non-ascii">
       <div class="nameRole"><span class="fn">Joe Hildebrand</span>
         (<span class="role">editor</span>)</div>
       <div class="org">Cisco Systems, Inc.</div>
     </div>
   </address>

9.3.  <annotation>

   This element is rendered as the text ", " (a comma and a space)
   followed by a span of class "annotation" at the end of a <reference>
   element, the span containing appropriately-transformed elements from
   the children of the <annotation> tag.

   , <span class="annotation">Some <em>thing</em>.</span>

9.4.  <area>

   Not currently rendered to HTML.

9.5.  <artwork>

   Artwork can either consist of inline text or SVG.  If the artwork is
   not inside a <figure> element, a pilcrow (Section 5.2) is included.
   Inside a <figure> element, the figure title serves the purpose of the
   pilcrow.  If the "align" attribute has the value "right", the CSS

Internet-Draft                  HTML RFC                       July 2016


   class "alignRight" will be added.  If the "align" attribute has the
   value "center", the CSS class "alignCenter" will be added.

9.5.1.  Text Artwork

   Text artwork is rendered inside an HTML <pre> element, which is
   contained by a <div> element for consistency with SVG artwork.  Note
   that CDATA blocks are not a part of HTML, so all <, >, and & must be
   escaped as &lt;, &gt;, and &amp;, respectively.

   The <div> element will have CSS classes of "artwork", "art-text", and
   "art-" prepended to the value of the <artwork> element's "type"
   attribute, if it exists.

   <div class="artwork art-text art-ascii-art"  id="s-1-2">
     <pre>
   ______________
   &lt; hello, world &gt;
   --------------
     \   ^__^
      \  (oo)\_______
         (__)\       )\/\
             ||----w |
             ||     ||
     </pre>
     <a class="pilcrow" href="#s-1-2">&para;</a>
   </div>

9.5.2.  SVG Artwork

   SVG artwork will be included inline.  The SVG is wrapped in a <div>
   element with CSS classes "artwork" and "art-svg".

   If the SVG artwork element is a child of <figure> and the artwork is
   specified as align='right', an empty HTML <span> element is added
   directly after the <svg> element, in order to get right alignment to
   work correctly in HTML rendering engines that do not support the
   flex-box model.

   Note: the alt attribute of <artwork> is not currently used for SVG;

9.5.3.  Other Artwork

   Other artwork will have a src attribute uses the "data" URI scheme
   defined in [RFC2397].  Such artwork is rendered in an HTML <img>
   element.  Note: the HTML <img> element does not have a closing slash.

   Note: such images are not yet allowed by the RFC Series Editor, even
   though the format supports them.  The RFC Series Editor may allow a
   limited set of "data:" mediatypes for artwork in the future.

   <div class="artwork art-logo" id="s-2-58">

9.6.  <aside>

   This element is rendered as an HTML <aside> element, with all child
   content appropriately transformed.

   <aside id="s-2.1-2">

     </p>
   </aside>

9.7.  <author>

   The <author> element is used in several places in the output.
   Different rendering is used for each.

9.7.1.  Authors in Document Information

   As seen in the Document Information at the beginning of the HTML,
   each document author is rendered as an HTML <div> tag of class
   "author".

Internet-Draft                  HTML RFC                       July 2016


   Inside the <div class="author"> HTML tag, the author's initials and
   surname (or the fullname, if it exists and the others do not) will be
   rendered in an HTML <div> tag of class "author-name".  If the
   <author> contains "asciiInitials" and "asciiSurname" attributes, or
   contains as "asciiFullname" attribute, the author's name is rendered
   twice, with the first being the non-ASCII version, wrapped in an HTML
   <span> tag of class "non-ascii", followed by the ASCII version
   wrapped in an HTML <span> tag of class "ascii", wrapped in
   parentheses.  If the <author> has a "role" attribute of "editor", the
   <div class="author-name"> will also contain the text ", " (comma,
   space), followed by an HTML <span> tag of class "editor", which
   contains the text "Ed.".

   If the <author> element contains an <organization> element, it is
   also rendered inside the <div class="author"> HTML tag.

   <div class="author">
     <div class="author-name">
       H. Flanagan,
       <span class="editor">Ed.</span></div>
     <div class="org">Test Org</div>
   </div>
   <div class="author">
     <div class="author-name">
       <span class="non-ascii">Hildebrand</span>
       (<span class="ascii">HILDEBRAND</span>)
     </div>
     <div class="org">
       <span class="non-ascii">Test Org</span>
       (<span class="ascii">TEST ORG</span>)
     </div>
   </div>

9.7.2.  Authors of this document

   As seen in Authors' Addresses, at the end of the HTML, each document
   author is rendered into an HTML <address> element with the CSS class
   "vcard".

   The HTML <address> element will contain an HTML <div> with CSS class
   "nameRole".  That div will contain an HTML <span> element with CSS
   class "fn" containing the value of the "fullname" attribute of the
   <author> XML element, and an HTML <span> element with CSS class
   "role" containing the value of the "role" attribute of the <author>
   XML element (if there is a role).  Parentheses will surround the
   <span class="role">, if it exists.

   <address class="vcard">
     <div class="nameRole">
       <span class="fn">Joe Hildebrand</span>
       (<span class="role">editor</span>)
     </div>
     ...

   After the name, the <organization> and <address> child elements of
   the author are rendered inside the HTML <address> tag.

   When the <author> element or any of its descendant elements has any
   attribute that starts with "ascii", all of the author information is
   displayed twice.  The first version is wrapped in an HTML <div> tag
   with class "ascii"; this version prefers the ASCII version of
   information, such as "asciiFullname", but falls back on the non-ASCII
   version if the ASCII version doesn't exist.  The second version is
   wrapped in an HTML <div> tag with class "non-ascii"; this version
   prefers the non-ASCII version of information, such as "fullname", but
   falls back on the ASCII version if the non-ASCII version does not
   exist.  Between these two HTML <div>s, a third <div> is inserted,
   with class "alternative-contact", containing the text "Alternate
   contact information:".

   <address class="vcard">
     <div class="ascii">
       <div class="nameRole">
         <span class="fn">The ASCII name</span>
     </div>
     <div class="alternative-contact">
       Alternate contact information:
     </div>
     <div class="non-ascii">
       <div class="nameRole">
         <span class="fn">The non-ASCII name</span>
         (<span class="role">editor</span>)</div>
     </div>
   </address>

9.7.3.  Authors of references

   In the output generated from a reference element, author tags are
   rendered inside an HTML <span> element with CSS class "refAuthor".
   See [RFC7322], section 4.8.6.2 for which sections of the author name
   to use.

   <span class="refAuthor">Flanagan, H.</span> and
   <span class="refAuthor">N. Brownlee</span>

9.8.  <back>

   If there is exactly one <references> child, renders that child
   similarly to a <section>.  If there are more than one <references>
   child, renders as a <section> whose name is "References", containing
   a <section> for each <references>.

   After any <references> sections, renders each <section> child as
   appendices.

   <section id="n-references">

9.10.  <blockquote>

   This element renders as the similar HTML <blockquote> element.  If
   there is a "cite" attribute, it is copied to the HTML cite attribute.
   If there is a "quoteFrom" attribute, it is placed inside a <cite>
   element at the end of the quote, with an <a> element surrounding it
   (if there is a "cite" attribute), linking to the "cite" URL.

   If the blockquote does not contain another element that gets a
   pilcrow (Section 5.2), a pilcrow is added.

   Note that the "&mdash;" at the beginning of the <cite> element should
   be a proper emdash, which is difficult to show in the current format
   of this format.

   <blockquote id="s-1.2-1"
     cite="http://...">
     <p id="s-1.2-2">Four score and seven years ago our fathers
       brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived

   The IPR boilerplate for the document appears directly after the
   Abstract.  The children of the input <boilerplate> element are
   treated similarly to unnumbered sections.

   appropriate "datetime" element will be generated in HTML.

   If this date is a child of the document's <front> element, it gets
   the CSS class "published".

   <references> element is used as the section name.

   <section id="n-my-references">

       <a href="#n-my-references class="selfRef">My References</a>
     </h2>
     ...
   </section>

   If there is more than one <references> element, an HTML <section>
   element is created to contain a sub-section for each of the
   <references>.  The section number will be the next section number
   after the last top-level <section> in <middle>.  The name of this
   section will be "References", and its "id" attribute will be
   "n-references".

9.43.  <region>

   This element is rendered as a <span> tag with CSS class "region".

   <span class="region">Colorado<span>

9.44.  <relref>

   This element is rendered as an HTML <a> tag with CSS class "relref"
   and "href" attribute of the "derivedLink" attribute of the element.
   Different values of the "displayFormat" attribute cause the text
   inside that HTML <a> tag to change, as well as extra text to be
   generated.  Some values of the "displayFormat" attribute also cause
   another HTML <a> tag to be rendered with CSS class "xref" and an
   "href" of "#" and the "target" attribute (modified by any applicable
   <displayreference> XML element) and text inside of the "target"
   attribute (modified by any applicable <displayreference> XML
   element).  When used, this <a class='xref'> HTML tag is always
   surrounded by square brackets, like "[<a class='xref'
   href='#foo'>foo</a>]".

9.44.1.  displayFormat='of'

   The output is an <a class='relref'> HTML tag, with contents of
   "Section " and the value of the "section" attribute.  This is
   followed by the word "of" (surrounded by whitespace).  This is
   followed by the <a class='xref'> HTML tag (surrounded by square
   brackets).

   For example, with an input of:

   for an overview.

9.44.2.  displayFormat='comma'

   The output is an <a class='xref'> HTML tag (wrapped by square
   brackets), followed by a comma (","), followed by whitespace,
   followed by an <a class='relref'> HTML tag, with contents of
   "Section " and the value of the "section" attribute.

   For example, with an input of:

   See <relref section="2.3" target="RFC7878" displayFormat="comma"
   derivedLink="http://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc7878#s-2.3"/>,

   for an overview.

9.44.3.  displayFormat='parens'

   The output is an <a> element with "href" attribute whose value is the
   value of the "target" attribute prepended by "#", and whose content
   is the value of the "target" attribute; the entire element is wrapped
   in square brackets.  This is followed by whitespace.  This is
   followed by an <a> element whose "href" attribute is the value of the
   "derivedLink" attribute and whose content is the value of the
   "derivedRemoteContent" attribute; the entire element is wrapped in
   parentheses.

   For example, if Section 2.3 of RFC 7878 has the title "Protocol
   Overview", for an input of:

9.47.  <seriesInfo>

   This element is rendered in an HTML <span> element with CSS name
   "seriesInfo".

   <span class="seriesInfo">RFC 5646</span>

9.48.  <sourcecode>

   This element is rendered in an HTML <pre> with a CSS class of
   "sourcecode".  Note that CDATA blocks do not work consistently in
   HTML, so all <, >, and & must be escaped as &lt;, &gt;, and &amp;,
   respectively.  If the input XML has a "type" attribute, another CSS
   class of "lang-" and the type is added.

   If the sourcecode is not inside a <figure> element, a pilcrow
   (Section 5.2) is included.  Inside a <figure> element, the figure
   title serves the purpose of the pilcrow.

   <pre class="sourcecode lang-c">

9.66.  <xref>

   This element is rendered as an HTML <a> element containing an
   appropriate local link as the "href" attribute.  The value of the
   "href" attribute is taken from the "target" attribute, prepended by
   "#".  The <a> element generated will have class "xref".  The contents
   of the <a> element are the value of the "derivedContent" attribute.
   If the "format" attribute has the value "default", and the "target"
   attribute points to a <reference> or <referencegroup> element, then
   the generated <a> element is surrounded by square brackets in the
   output.

10.  IANA Considerations

   This document contains no actions for IANA

11.  Security Considerations

   Since RFCs are sometimes exchanged outside the normal Web sandboxing
   mechanism (such as using the "rsync" program to a mirror site) then
   loaded from a local file, more care must be taken with the HTML than
   is ordinary on the web.

12.  Acknowledgments

   Heather Flanangan was an early co-author of this document and helped
   its formation.  The authors gratefully acknowledge the contributions
   of: Patrick Linskey, and the members of the RFC Format Design Team
   (Nevil Brownlee, Sandy Ginoza, Tony Hansen, Ted Lemon, Julian
